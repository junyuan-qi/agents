[Agents Repository]

This repository is dedicated to developing and experimenting with multiple personal agents to assist with various tasks. The goal is to create, test, and compare different agent frameworks and implementations for productivity, creativity, and personal management.

## Planned Agents

- **Writing Agent**: Assists with drafting, editing, and organizing written content.
- **Time Management Agent**: Helps schedule tasks, set reminders, and optimize daily routines.
- **Brainstorming Agent**: Facilitates idea generation and creative thinking sessions.
- **Other Agents**: Additional agents for research, learning, automation, and more.

## Agent Frameworks

This repository may include agents built with different frameworks, such as:
- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
- [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
- [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)
- Custom or experimental frameworks

## Repository Structure

- Each agent will have its own directory with documentation, code, and usage instructions.
- Framework-specific experiments will be organized for easy comparison.

## Getting Started
